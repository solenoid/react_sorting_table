TODO write this thing for real.

### Requirements
node and npm minimally, but figure out precisely how best to say this.

### Setup
```
npm install       # get dev and app dependencies
npm run build-dev # first time setup for local development
npm start         # run webpack dev server and thin backend server
```

### ES6 Cheatsheet
In case the newer syntax is throwing you for a loop.

#### Imports / Exports specifically
Because it can be a little odd until understood.

### TODOs
* improve css and html build to be on par with the js build
* get in the react router in a sensible manner
* start bumping the version according to URL changes
* continue to improve everything... forever!
